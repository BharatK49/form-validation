# ✅ Client-Side Form Validation

A simple, clean registration form built to demonstrate real-time, client-side form validation using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. This project validates user input before submitting to a server, providing immediate and clear feedback to the user.

This project was built as part of a web technology lab exercise.

# ✨ Key Features & Validation Rules
This form provides instant feedback by checking inputs against a set of rules as soon as the user tries to submit.

Real-time Feedback: Inputs are styled with a red border (.error) for invalid data or a green border (.success) for valid data.

Dynamic Error Messages: Specific error messages appear below the field to guide the user.

Submission Prevention: The form's default submission is blocked using event.preventDefault() until all fields are valid.
